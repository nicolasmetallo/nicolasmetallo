I'm a data scientist and maker currently based in London, UK. I'm interested in building products that solve real-world problems, work for everyone, and make sense in the community they are built into. I also grew up in my beloved Conurbano in Argentina, I'm a River Plate's fan, a food lover and an avidðŸ§‰&nbsp; drinker. 

- ðŸ”­&nbsp; Iâ€™m currently working as a senior data scientist at AWS
- ðŸŒ±&nbsp; Iâ€™m currently learning about front-end web development, transformers, and 
- ðŸ‘¯&nbsp; Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open source projects, "make the world a better place" ideas, and just fun conversations around tech and the world
- ðŸ’¬ &nbsp;Ask me about MLOps, how to pivot your career to data science, or anything ML related
- âš¡&nbsp; Fun fact: I love trains so going from Beijing to Moscow via Ulaanbaatar on the Trans-Siberian was one of the best journeys I've made ðŸš‚
